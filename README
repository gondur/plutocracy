  2. Compiling and Installing Plutocracy
================================================================================

Currently Plutocracy is known to work on the following systems:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2.1  POSIX systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to install the following development packages:

        libsdl-dev
        libsdl-image-dev
        libsdl-ttf-dev

Plutocracy is packaged with autotools. Compile with:

        ./configure && make

There are no special configure flags currently. Install with:

        make install

See the INSTALL file for generic instructions for Autotools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2.2  Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plutocracy cannot compiled for Windows using Autotools or MinGW because the
supporting SDL libraries are not available for MinGW.

The vc8 directory contains a solution and project file setup for compiling
Plutocracy with Visual Studio 2005. You will need to download and setup the
following SDKs:

        SDL         http://libsdl.org/
        SDL_image   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
        SDL_ttf     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

To run Plutocracy after compiling, download the runtime DLLs:

        http://pub.risujin.org/plutocracy/plutocracy_win32_dlls.zip
