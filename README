2. Compiling and Installing Plutocracy
======================================

  Currently Plutocracy is known to work on the following systems:


  2.1  POSIX systems
  ------------------

    You will need to install the following development packages:

       libsdl-dev
       libsdl-image-dev
       libsdl-ttf-dev

    Plutocracy is packaged with autotools. Compile with:

       ./configure && make

    There are no special configure flags currently. Install with:

       make install

    See the INSTALL file for generic instructions for Autotools.


  2.2  Windows
  ------------

    Plutocracy cannot compiled for Windows using Autotools or MinGW because the
    supporting SDL libraries are not available for MinGW.

    The vc8 directory contains a solution and project file setup for compiling
    Plutocracy with Visual Studio 2005. You will need to download and setup the
    following SDKs:

      SDL         http://libsdl.org/
      SDL_image   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
      SDL_ttf     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

    To run Plutocracy after compiling, download the runtime DLLs:

      http://pub.risujin.org/plutocracy/plutocracy_win32_dlls.zip



3. Playing Plutocracy
=====================

  Plutocracy is not yet playable!
