  2. Compiling and Installing Plutocracy
================================================================================

Currently Plutocracy is known to work on the following systems:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2.1  POSIX systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to install the following development packages:

    libsdl-dev
    libsdl-image-dev
    libsdl-ttf-dev

Plutocracy is packaged with autotools. Compile with:

    ./configure && make
    
There are no special configure flags currently. Install with:

    make install
    
See the INSTALL file for generic instructions for Autotools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2.2  Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plutocracy cannot compiled for Windows using Autotools or MinGW because the
supporting SDL libraries are not available for MinGW.

The vc8 directory contains a solution and project file setup for compiling
Plutocracy with Visual Studio 2005. You will need to download and setup the
following SDKs:

    SDL         http://libsdl.org/
    SDL_image   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
    SDL_ttf     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
