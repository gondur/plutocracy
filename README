1. Release Information
======================

  This is an SVN development version and has not officially been released. There
  is no guarantee of compatibility or that it will even compile!

2. Compiling and Installing Plutocracy
======================================

  Currently Plutocracy is known to work on the following systems:


  2.1  POSIX systems
  ------------------

    On a Debian/Ubuntu system you will need to install the following
    development packages in addition to your normal compiling environment:

      libsdl-dev
      libsdl-image-dev
      libsdl-ttf-dev
      zlib1g-dev
      scons

    Plutocracy is packaged with SCons. Compile with:

      $ scons

    To install run the following command:

      $ scons install PREFIX=/usr

    The 'PREFIX' argument determines what directory root the program will be
    installed under (defaults to '/usr/local'). For additional build targets
    run scons help:

      $ scons -h

    Note that after SCons is run for the first time (even if with the -h flag),
    it will create 'custom.py', the configuration file, and draw its options
    from there instead of from the environment. Specify changes over the
    command-line after this point or remove the configuration file.


  2.2  Windows with Visual Studio
  -------------------------------

    The windows\vc8 directory contains a solution and project file setup for
    compiling Plutocracy with Visual Studio 2005. The windows directory
    includes the following SDKs and the project file is already setup to
    use them:

      SDL         http://libsdl.org/
      SDL_ttf     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
      zlib        http://www.zlib.net/
      libpng      http://www.libpng.org/

    To run Plutocracy after compiling, download the runtime DLLs:

      http://pub.risujin.org/plutocracy/plutocracy_win32_dlls.zip


  2.2  Windows with MinGW
  -----------------------

    Plutocracy can be compiled for MinGW using SCons. You will need to install
    and setup the following programs:

      Python      http://www.python.org/download/
      SCons       http://www.scons.org/
      MinGW       http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml

    Note that MinGW is required, MSys is not necessary. You will need to
    configure the PATH environment variable to contain the path of the
    MinGW bin directory:

      1.) Right click on 'My Computer'
      2.) Select 'Properties'
      3.) Select 'Advanced' tab
      4.) Press 'Environment Variables'
      5.) Select 'PATH' in the top listbox
      6.) Press 'Edit'
      7.) Enter the path to the Python, Python Scripts, and MinGW bin
          directories followed by a semicolon before any paths that are
          already there:

            C:\Program Files\Python 2.5;
            C:\Program Files\Python 2.5\Scripts;
            C:\MSys\MinGW\bin;

    You should now be able to open a command prompt, navigate to the
    Plutocracy directory and compile using scons:

      C:\plutocracy> scons

    For additional build targets run scons help:

      C:\plutocracy> scons -h

    Note that after SCons is run for the first time (even if with the -h flag),
    it will create 'custom.py', the configuration file, and draw its options
    from there instead of from the environment. Specify changes over the
    command-line after this point or remove the configuration file.
