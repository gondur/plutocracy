2. Compiling and Installing Plutocracy
======================================

  Currently Plutocracy is known to work on the following systems:


  2.1  POSIX systems
  ------------------

    On a Debian/Ubuntu system you will need to install the following
    development packages in addition to your normal compiling environment:

      libsdl-dev
      libsdl-image-dev
      libsdl-ttf-dev
      zlib1g-dev
      scons

    Plutocracy is packaged with SCons. Compile with:

      $ scons

    To install run the following command:

      $ scons install prefix=/usr

    The 'prefix' argument determines what directory root the program will be
    installed under (defaults to '/usr/local'). For additional build targets
    run scons help:

      $ scons -h


  2.2  Windows
  ------------

    Plutocracy cannot compiled for Windows using SCons and MinGW because the
    supporting SDL libraries are not available for MinGW.

    The vc8 directory contains a solution and project file setup for compiling
    Plutocracy with Visual Studio 2005. You will need to download and setup the
    following SDKs:

      SDL         http://libsdl.org/
      SDL_image   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
      SDL_ttf     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
      zlib        http://www.zlib.net/

    To run Plutocracy after compiling, download the runtime DLLs:

      http://pub.risujin.org/plutocracy/plutocracy_win32_dlls.zip
