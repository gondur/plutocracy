## Inspirations ##

  * Tile bidding is loosely based on buying land tile-by-tile in [SimCity 2000 NE](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/simcity-2000-network-edition). The problem in this game is players could cheaply buy up "minefields" to prevent others from building anything bigger than 2x2 and other players had no way of taking back that land.
  * The idea of an economy-centric game set in the Caribbean was inspired by [Port Royale](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/port-royale-gold-power-and-pirates). This game was pretty stiff in restricting the player. You basically ascend through "ranks" by earning more money, which lets you own more ships and build more stuff to get even more money. Slow and pretty dull.
  * The game aims to be much simpler and faster than the [Civilization games](http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/civilization-series).
