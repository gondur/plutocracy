# Resource Value #
Ship crews and towns both consume food regularly and towns consume luxury items
to grow. The amount their need is satiated (and thus the amount they pay)
depends on the food or luxury value of the good. Additionally, towns value
luxury variety and will pay more for luxury items they rarely receive.

# Trees #
  * The map is largely covered in trees at the start of the game
  * Will regrow and forests can spread to adjacent tiles
  * Different types grow in different climates (with some randomness):
    * Cold tiles produce Conifer Trees
    * Moderate tiles produce Deciduous Trees
    * Hot tiles produce Palm Trees
  * Harvested from land you own by building Sawmills
  * Lumber efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Conifer trees: 100%
    * Deciduous trees: 50%
    * Palm trees: 25%
  * Fruit efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Conifer trees: 25%
    * Deciduous trees: 50%
    * Palm trees: 100%
