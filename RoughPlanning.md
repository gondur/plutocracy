# AI INDEPENDENCE (Majesty-esque) #

> - < Khent> Ship captains & naming your boats for a more personal touch. --  You pick captains for your ships, and give them orders, then the AI goes on their merry way doing what they do best.
< Khent> But the trick is that a good captain will do what you tell him to
13:10 < Khent> if you have a scoundrel he might just bend the rules
13:10 <@Garoth> Ah, we were hoping to avoid leveling or per-unit statistics.
13:10 < Khent> causing you diplomatic problems
13:10 < Khent> not leveling. Its the captains AI

13:13 <@Garoth> You can only give orders to your Captains when they are "at home"

13:13 <@Garoth> Not bad, if we can make it not overly annoying.
13:13 < Atom\_Eve> Or if you send a scout ship out to catch them.
13:13 < Khent> Well, I would say you can task orders for them (unlike magesty)

# CUSTOMIZABILITY #
13:31 < Atom\_Eve> A big thing for me is customizability. I like small touches

> that make things seem more yours.
13:31 < Atom\_Eve> Even if that's just, y'know, naming ships.
13:31 <@Garoth> Hmm, alright.
13:31 < Atom\_Eve> Little touches like that make games shine for me.
(customizing ships, naming boats/cities, etc -- optional stuff that can add a personal touch.)

# ISLAND SPECIALIZATION #
- Perhaps TCs only have a certain amount of slots for different kinds of upgrades -- weaver, mason, etc -- and nothing else.

CROPS
15:20 < risujin> ok, so some crops need certain climate?
15:21 <@Garoth> Naturally.
15:21 < risujin> dry/moderate/wet climates?
15:24 < risujin> your island has 20% tobacco-able tiles so focusing on tobacco
> will be inefficient

# Garoth's Mechanics Blah Blah #

13:38 <@Garoth> Some basics that aren't altogether there:
13:38 <@Garoth> 1) you rent land only
13:38 <@Garoth> 2) You're only a merchant, not a colonizer
13:39 <@Garoth> 3) You can only rent land adjacent to your land you already
> have and adjacent to settler ships
13:39 <@Garoth> 4) Resources will be kind of all over the place to facilitate
> trade
13:39 <@Garoth> 5) We were probably going to have raft-walls: you can build
> long walls on floating rafts in the middle of the sea and tax
> people coming through
13:40 <@Garoth> 6) You can sell to players as well as towns (AI controlled)
13:40 <@Garoth> 7) Person who makes the most wins
13:40 <@Garoth> 8) Losing doesn't kick you out, it just makes you restart
13:40 <@Garoth> (and you lose by running out of money, etc)
13:41 <@Garoth> 9) You can also choose to become a pirate, but you lose any
> land/buildings where you don't control the entire island
13:41 <@Garoth> That's all kind of vague for now though
13:42 < Lumoko> also "TC" stands for...
13:42 <@Garoth> Assets not included, I think. That makes it harder.
13:42 <@Garoth> Town Centre
13:42 < Lumoko> ok
13:42 <@Garoth> Oh, and about war
13:42 <@Garoth> You don't declare war, you belong to a nation
13:42 <@Garoth> your nation declares war
13:42 <@Garoth> (AI)
13:43 <@Garoth> When you are at war with another nation, you can't trade with
> them
13:43 <@Garoth> and you are forced to attack whatever it is of theirs that
> comes near
13:43 <@Garoth> I think...
13:43 < Lumoko> when a nation declares war and wins, does all properties on
> land become nationalized?
13:43 <@Garoth> Also, if you attack an island and take out the town centre, the
> island falls under your control and you must build a new TC
13:44 < Lumoko> man my english is terrible today
13:44 <@Garoth> Well, nations don't "win"
13:44 <@Garoth> I'm not even sure nations have ships, maybe they do
13:44 <@Garoth> It's more like "you can attack them now"
13:44 <@Garoth> Also, you can bribe your gov't to declare a war
13:44 <@Garoth> (as an influence only, not a certainty)
13:45 <@Garoth> And, like I said, if you manage to eradicate everything of
> someone's or make them run out of money, they simply start
> again (with a settler ship)
13:45 <@Garoth> But yes, in general, buildings aren't destroyed: they are
> converted
13:46 <@Garoth> you can also buy out someone's rented land by bidding on their
> tiles
13:46 <@Garoth> And then whatever is on it becomes yours
13:46 <@Garoth> You can attack buildings also, but only from the sea (as the
> only "units" are ships)
13:46 <@Garoth> However, chances are, you want to attack the TC to take over
> the whole island without crippling it
13:47 < Lumoko> that's great how the type of tree effects what lumber you get
13:47 <@Garoth> :)
13:47 <@Garoth> One thing that we really want to avoid: micromanagement
13:47 <@Garoth> So you shouldn't have to constantly monitor/interact with
> something
13:47 <@Garoth> avoid presenting ideas that make this the case
13:48 < Lumoko> what do you mean by efficiency there though? higher quality
> tree=higher price, or faster production...?
13:48 < Lumoko> ok
13:48 <@Garoth> Example: your selling price. You don't want to constantly
> adjust all your selling prices so we have a system where it can
> fluctuate based on presets

# Lumoko's Suggestions #

14:11 < Lumoko> like if we presented it where the game was all about the player
> finding the best way to exploit and backstab his competition
> all for his narrow minded sense of greed...
14:12 < Lumoko> I started thinking a lot about the reputation of the player
> merchant
14:13 < Lumoko> that the player was always in a battle to appear to be a
> valuable trustworthy retailer, all the while he is secretely
> moonlighting as a pirate
14:13 < Lumoko> another thing are you selling to the country or to town centres
> or to specific shops

14:20 < Lumoko> I'm trying to really think, I might seem blunt headed by
> repeatedly asking this but... what is the angle? is there a
> word or phrase that can sum up the tone of the game. has one
> been established
14:20 <@Garoth> "Plutocracy"
14:21 <@Garoth> But no, no particular atmosphere or phrase has been
> established. We're mostly copying the feel of 1600s carribean
> colonization
14:21 <@Garoth> But that can very easily be changed
14:21 < Lumoko> with crayon physics and those other independant games they all
> an edge, a feeling, a split second image in your mind of what
> the game is

14:22 < Lumoko> I love the word Plutocracy
14:22 < Lumoko> what it brings out in my mind is the definition
14:22 < Lumoko> those who have, are in control
14:22 <@Garoth> :)
14:22 < Lumoko> I think about what they can do
14:22 < Lumoko> I think about what they can get away with
14:23 < Lumoko> what they can bend
14:23 < Lumoko> what will these merchants go to to get it all
14:23 < Lumoko> it brings to me an image of power hungry exploitation
14:23 <@Garoth> Good, good :)
14:23 < Lumoko> that the player shouldn't care about the development of a new
> world, only his domination of it
14:24 < Lumoko> that is the whole reason why we play the game
14:24 < Lumoko> Is to WIN
14:25 <@Garoth> The game is about bribery and getting wealth with any cost
14:25 < Lumoko> and that is all the player really is when he plays the game,
> putting into course a set of actions which will allow him to
> take control
14:25 <@Garoth> War, trickery, trade -- whatever it takes
14:25 < Lumoko> exactly
14:25 <@Garoth> And you don't need to manage your population
14:25 < Lumoko> thats why for me the one word description of the game is
> "Bastards"
14:25 < Lumoko> the plyaer Must do anything and everythiing in his power to win
14:26 < Lumoko> HE MUST go below the law, stretch his powers
14:26 < Lumoko> Risk his life power just one shot at success
14:26 <@Garoth> Perhaps piracy shouldn't be so much of a mode as a secret thing
> yo udo on the side
14:26 < Lumoko> if he blows it he loses
14:26 < Lumoko> that's what I was thinking
14:26 < Lumoko> its all a ruse
14:27 <@Garoth> That does sound appealing
14:27 < Lumoko> you promote yourself as honest and a hero for helping the
> settlers
14:27 < Lumoko> but you are only using them and exploiting them in any way you
> can just so you can beat 4 other players and say "I WON"
14:27 < Lumoko> that is the game for me
14:27 <@Garoth> :)
14:27 < Lumoko> "BASTARDS"
14:27 <@Garoth> Very good.

14:31 < Lumoko> yeah, the marriage idea was more of an image
14:31 < Lumoko> not necessarily a concept
14:31 <@Garoth> ok.
14:31 < Lumoko> just the image of the player using his family as leverage to
> get a sale, shameless

14:32 < Lumoko> my thoughts on piracy...
14:33 < Lumoko> it just seems that if a player got to a point where he owned
> several islands, the other country might recognize that threat
> and form some sort of alliance to stop them
14:34 < Lumoko> what I gathered was that winning through military was hard
14:34 < Lumoko> very  hard
14:34 < Garoth> Yes, it probably would be
14:34 < Lumoko> it a merchant is realized as a criminal, he could dump all his
> businesses, flee and use all his portable property to live the
> life of a pirate
14:35 < Lumoko> he can attack and gain resources easily, but its impossible to
> compete with the other players in terms of getting money
14:35 < Lumoko> the stable stable economy, he has to hunt
14:35 < Lumoko> wow
14:35 < Lumoko> they have a stable economy
14:36 < Lumoko> sorry horrible mental typo there
14:36 < Garoth> :)
14:36 < Garoth> But yeah, that is how it is at the moment
14:36 < Garoth> becoming a pirate = new mode of playing
14:36 < Lumoko> so, I like that he can take buildings and islands
14:36 < Lumoko> yes i like that
14:36 < Lumoko> I just want to make that difficult though
14:37 < Lumoko> because then the player might try to automatically forfeit his
> merchantship and go straight to it
14:37 < Garoth> So that everyone doesn't go pirate all the time?
14:37 < Lumoko> i don't know
14:37 < Lumoko> yeah
14:37 < Garoth> Yeah, we figured you could
14:37 < Garoth> But our terms are that you lose all land where you don't own
> the entire island
14:37 < Garoth> So it is desperate
14:38 < Garoth> And you're at war with everyone all the time
14:38 < Lumoko> also I like the idea of the player of trying to take on the
> fleets of the Allied Nations and having a blockbuster of a
> standoff
14:38 < Garoth> Which makes trade difficult (we were thinking that you could
> maybe disguise your ships)
14:38 < Lumoko> creating an epic moment where everything is on the line
14:38 < Lumoko> well, a pirate would still be able to sell his cargo, but only
> to illegal joints at a horrendously lowered cost
14:39 < Garoth> But, well, what illegal joints?
14:39 < Lumoko> they can steal for next to free but selling nets little profit
14:39 < Lumoko> at the town centre
14:39 < Lumoko> same setup just scummier prices
14:39 < Garoth> But as a pirate, you're at war with everyone
14:39 < Garoth> so enemies are forced to attack you at sight
14:39 < Garoth> Which is why I'm suggesting disguise
14:40 < Lumoko> ok
14:40 < Garoth> So you can blend in with a trade convoy or something :)
14:40 < Garoth> Or sell to reputable ports, with some % chance of being noticed
> as a pirate
14:40 < Lumoko> that works
14:41 < Lumoko> if the pirate owns an island, he has to becomeself-sustainable
> or his people start going under right?
14:41 < Garoth> Yeah, something like that
14:41 < Lumoko> ok
14:42 < Lumoko> I'm not sure where I was going with that, but I thought it
> needed to be addressed
14:42 < Garoth> Oh, the other possibility other than disguise is being able to
> set some options for your towns: like level of ignorance to who
> is selling
14:42 < Lumoko> would that be like selling to the less reputable joints?
14:42 < Garoth> Yes.
14:43 < Garoth> Yeah, that fits better into the vision of the game, I think
14:44 < Garoth> And it'd be funny if a port suddenly became hostile to you :)
14:44 < Lumoko> lol. to what extent can the Pirate extort others?
14:44 < Garoth> The only issue: what, then, makes you want to be reputable at
> all?
14:44 < Garoth> The Pirate can attack any ship whereas allied nations can't
> attack each other on neuteral ships
14:44 < Garoth> when a pirate takes over or destroys a ship, he can take the
> cargo -- or some of it at least
14:45 < Garoth> as in: when you destroy a ship, you can grab the floating
> supplies
14:45 < Lumoko> i was thinking that a high reputation gave you stronger sales,
> people want you goods more so they will pay more for them.
> likewise a horrible reputation allowed you to bully shops(or
> whatever) with greater efficiency
14:46 < Garoth> That might be interesting... though it'd take some thinking
> for game mechanics
14:46 < Lumoko> so players could pay to spread terrible rumours of them to
> make them more intimidating
14:46 < Lumoko> my idea that playing as a pirate is hard, but still winable
14:46 < Lumoko> you're just simply being more honest about how corrupt you are

14:47 < Lumoko> I was reading a few of the logs earlier and you talked about
> captains, not following orders
14:48 < Garoth> It's a possibility, yes
14:49 < Lumoko> you can use your reputation to bolster morale, use propaganda
> to attempt to convince captains to join your side (with 0.01%
> chance of success)
14:49 < Lumoko> I also wrote down the idea of respawning failed players again
14:49 < Garoth> Well, i've been saying that all along
14:49 < Lumoko> so it looks like that was already covered, and I'm happy to
> hear that
14:50 < Garoth> you don't get kicked, you just start again
14:50 < Lumoko> i fully support that
14:50 < Lumoko> yeah
14:50 < Garoth> With a measely little settler ship :0
14:50 < Garoth> And you have to find land already partway into the game
14:51 < AC|McPhail> Is there a limit to the # of restarts, or a timelimit
> > before you can't anymore? I'd imagine late game it would
> > be pointless.
14:51 < Lumoko> that is true
14:51 < Lumoko> I also delved into the possibility of players being able to

> hire private investigators to expose players involved in shady
> activities
14:51 < Garoth> Well, I think no limit
14:52 < Garoth> But you can quit if you don't want to try again
14:52 < Lumoko> player puts money into paying for successful operation, more
> money = less chance of getting caught or investigation
> revealing anything
14:53 < Garoth> Yeah, a mechanism like that might be possible
14:53 < Lumoko> players can put money into P.I. but must mulitply initial
> player investment in order to have a shot at it
14:53 < Lumoko> and not all the time will the investigations work
14:53 < Lumoko> performing the perfect crime
14:53 < Lumoko> that is how a merchant can be thrust into piracy in first place
14:54 < Garoth> Perhaps if your reputation is low enough, you will find more
> reasons to be a pirate than a reasonable merchant
14:54 < Lumoko> reputation also factoring into how well it can be pulled off
14:54 < Lumoko> yeah
14:55 < Lumoko> piracy shouldn't be viewed as inevitable
14:55 < Lumoko> yyou should want to hold in as a merchant because it is more
> profitable, but pirates (in order to win) literally have to
> take on the world in order to win
14:56 < Lumoko> also the idea of everyone having to play dirty in order to win
14:56 < Garoth> The nice thing is that pirates can probably work together
14:56 < Garoth> Man, this game is sounding way more exciting since you joined
> :)
14:57 < Lumoko> every needs to dip in to gain an edge, key is closest without
> goung over
14:57 < Lumoko> fucking right
14:57 < Lumoko> pirate unions
14:57 < Lumoko> tha
14:57 < Lumoko> t
14:57 < Lumoko> is awesome

15:00 < Garoth> So, in fact, it would be best for a pirate to try to rock the
> boat as much as possible and set up a lot of war
15:00 < Garoth> and then pick people off one by one
15:00 < Lumoko> hard, but still winable
15:00 < Lumoko> it shouldn't be a death sentence
15:00 < Lumoko> but just really really hard
15:00 < Garoth> No, and you don't have to do that
15:00 < Garoth> you could just be an honest little pirate and pillage ships
> and sell the goods
15:01 < Lumoko> but that would be hard to compete with other players though

15:14 < Lumoko> another small thought of mine was that players could import a
> small jpeg (or whatever file) as their company logo. It would
> appear on their property and ships. Would only be balck and
> white and would be toned in the player character's colour.
15:14 < Garoth> Yeah, that's a good idea... except that some pricks would use
> dicks :)
15:14 < Lumoko> Just a little touch, you guys mentioned in your logs about
> wanting to have customization so people can grow fond of their
> creation
15:14 < Lumoko> lol
15:14 < Garoth> I love the idea, I'm just frightened
15:14 < Lumoko> tubgirl...
15:16 < Lumoko> or you include premade ones

15:18 < Lumoko> another small idea was that of a little advisor or whatever.
> Just a little personified mascot of the game in the corners of
> the menus or whatever. Helps give the game an image and brand
15:18 < Garoth> Advisor?
15:18 < Garoth> For what?
15:18 < Lumoko> i dunno
15:18 < Lumoko> like in civ
15:18 < Lumoko> civ 3 at least
15:18 < Garoth> Like "Your people are starving, my lord" from lords?
15:18 < Lumoko> just a little person
15:18 < Lumoko> kinda
15:19 < Garoth> "Your people think you're an idiot, my lord"
15:19 < Lumoko> just to have a brand image
15:19 < Lumoko> a personification of your deceit and exploitation
15:19 < Lumoko> he should be British
15:19 < Lumoko> lol

15:22 < Lumoko> Completely shoot down able - The idea that the player could
> choose a perk and fault at the beginning of the game
15:22 < Lumoko> this is shaky on equal playing but hear it out
15:23 < Lumoko> The player can pick a completely optional perk from a list at
> the beginning of the match that effects the playing style.
15:23 < Lumoko> Each perk has a positive and negative effect, most often
> binaries.
15:25 < Lumoko> some ones I wrote down were "Rick kid" more initial starting
> funds, but harder to sell to poorer shops (at this point this
> could be modifyed to mean that the "less reputable joints" in
> pirate mode would give you a harder time and give you less
> money on sales.
15:26 < Lumoko> "Luck" more random events happen, both good and bad to you
> (such as abandoned ship filled with gold, or outbreaks or
> scurvy)
15:27 < Lumoko> "Badass" easier to intimidate but lower salesl (for pirate
> inclined players)
15:29 < Lumoko> "Expensive Taste" At begining of year, you spend 10% of past
> year's earnings on extravagant party and as such morale,
> reputation, and foreign relations improve dependant on how
> much you spend (Great benefits but greatly costly later in the
> game, although initial benefits are slimmer)
15:31 < Lumoko> "Sodomite" Extreme limitations of any public relations

> your secret, but can sometimes make greater sales unavailable

15:31 < Lumoko> You get the drift, the titles and effects can be made up and
> need to be fair and balanced.
15:32 < Lumoko> I fear that it would be too much work to do these individually
> and might lead to excessive abuses in power unforseen at time
> of creation
15:32 < Lumoko> but it can add a lot of replayability through experimentation
15:32 < Lumoko> so really wuite the double edged sword to be honest
15:33 < AC|McPhail> Lumoko: A good random event would be a storm at sea
15:33 < Lumoko> As mentioned in the "Luck" perk
15:33 < Lumoko> yeah I was going to get to that
15:33 < Lumoko> will we have random events
15:33 < Lumoko> that was something I wanted to address
15:34 < Lumoko> I thought about religion in terms of alling with nations and
> reputation, being able to sell better to same religious towns,
> but that seems too unnecessary
15:35 < Lumoko> the possiblity of ghost ships... :)
15:36 < Lumoko> and maybe the idea of having a starting business
15:36 < Lumoko> so if a player chose his starting business as a farmer, then
> all the farms that he owns would gain a production bonus. But
> this is tossable
15:37 < Lumoko> And that pretty much tops it off for now
15:38 < Lumoko> I guess I just really wanted to get at the ideas of the player
> being an exploitative "bastard" and pushing breaking the law
> to the limit and trying to get away with it as a key concept
> of gameplay
15:38 < Lumoko> Thanks Folks.
